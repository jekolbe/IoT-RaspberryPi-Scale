## About the project
The **aim** of this project is to present a way to use a Raspberry Pi Model 1 and a load cell as a scale. The Pi should then be configured as an IoT device via Azure IoT Hub. All the data streamed to the IoT Hub should then be presented on a ASP.NET Web App by using Azure Function.
All the source code referenced in this project can be found either in this repository or in one of the following repositories:
* [Azure Function](https://github.com/jekolbe/IoT-RaspberryPi-Scale-Azure-Function)
* [ASP.NET Web App](https://github.com/jekolbe/IoT-RaspberryPi-Scale-WebApp)
